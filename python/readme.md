1. Required Libraries:

You need to install two Python libraries:

    pandas (for handling CSV files)
    python-docx (for generating and formatting the Word document)

You can install these libraries using the following commands:


pip install pandas python-docx

2. Code Execution:

The script will ask for two inputs:

    The path to the CSV file (input file).
    The path to save the DOCX file (output file).

3. Example Input/Output:

    Example of a CSV file input path:
        C:/path_to_your_file/example.csv
